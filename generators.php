                                <h2>Automatic Stand-by Generators for Homes and Businesses </h2>
                                <p>Having a reliable automatic stand-by generator is imperative to ensure your home
                                    or business has 24/7 protection from power disruptions. After all, nobody wants
                                    to deal with the hassle of being without the lights, air conditioning, heating
                                    and other appliances in your home during a power outage.</p>

                                <h2>Have Peace Of Mind When The Power Goes out</h2>
                                <p>Today's generators are quiet and can power your whole home or business. Whole
                                    house generators keep the lights, security system, sump pump, television,
                                    healthcare equipment, heating and cooling system, even the fridge working during
                                    electrical power outages. A standby generator detects when the power is cut to
                                    your house and automatically starts up in a few seconds to restore full
                                    electrical power to your home, now that's peace of mind.</p>
