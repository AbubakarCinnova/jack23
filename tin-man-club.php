                                <p>As your Heating and Cooling equipment ages, the more valuable a maintenance program
                                    becomes. The savings from
                                    one major repair could save you more than the service agreement itself. Regular
                                    service of your equipment is
                                    like changing the oil in your vehicle. You can save thousands in energy costs and
                                    future repairs, as well as
                                    extend the life of your HVAC system.</p>

                                <h2>Top Priority Status</h2>
                                <p>You are a Tin Man Club preferred customer when you are a member of the Annual Tin Man
                                    Club Service Plan. That
                                    means when you need service, you get priority scheduling, with no overtime rates and
                                    no lengthy waiting when
                                    your system is out of order. Jack's Heating and Cooling has emergency service
                                    available.</p>

                                <h2>Longer Equipment Life</h2>
                                <p>With the special care, you receive with the Tin Man Club Service Plan, your heating
                                    and cooling equipment will
                                    last longer and run more efficiently.</p>

                                <h2>Energy Savings</h2>
                                <p>The money you'll save by maintaining your equipment in top running order with a Tin
                                    Man Club Service Plan
                                    membership will add up to big savings on your heating and cooling costs.</p>

                                <h2>Fulfillment of Warranty Requirements</h2>
                                <p>If your HVAC components are under warranty, you should know that most manufacturers
                                    require evidence of annual
                                    maintenance to pay a claim. An investment in regular maintenance is essentially
                                    giving you an insurance policy.
                                    If something malfunctions that are covered under warranty, youâ€™ll be able to file
                                    your claim with more confidence
                                    and ease with evidence of annual maintenance.</p>
